# WorkOut Platform - Current Status & Next Steps

This document tracks the comprehensive implementation progress and outlines remaining development tasks.

## Latest Updates (December 2024)

### **Modern Authentication Modal System ✅**
Just completed a major UX improvement by converting the traditional login/signup pages to a modern modal-based system:

   - Mobile-responsive design with proper touch targets

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - React Context API for modal state management
